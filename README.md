# Canteen-Billing-System
A Billing System for Supermarkets, retail outlets and small shops. 

I made this as my final project for Computer Science during my 12th class with a very limited knowledge of programming in C++.
But thats also where its importance lies. As other languages, and even C++ can be used to make a better project with an average level knowledge of the language, due to my limited knowledge, the things used here, although lengthy are simple and can easily be understood by even beginner level programmmers. 

These are old programs that's why I am not going to dwell much upon them. But I think the one named 'INVES2(5)' should be the latest one and should work.
